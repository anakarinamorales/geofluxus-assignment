This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`ant-design/ant-design-examples`](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design-examples).

## Getting Started

First install de depencencies:

```bash
npm i
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Personal notes

-   Some colors on the design have no consistency (primary texts with different colors across pages). So, I'm picking one for each type of component and using across the whole app to keep it consistent.
-   What's the hover color of the select item element?
-   No consistent gap between report items in the layout. I'm using the most often used gap value for this app.
-   Inner section titles are not consistent throughout the design (I'm taking into consideration the ful report design here), so I choose to keep the titles without the numbers before them, so it's consistent in all pages.

## TO DO

-   Change Select font style to match design
-   Change Text font style using the Layout compnent
